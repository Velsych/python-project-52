### **Hello on my forth and final project(only god will know what have i done) on my own**

Alsy again here, another one web-app now on Django. I'd better stay on Flask ngl.

# Demo url:

https://python-project-52-4zei.onrender.com/

<ins>Can take a while, while host booting, also DB soon expire so yea.</ins>


### __**What that thing can do?**__
U can login/register. Make labels, marks, assign ppl to do tasks and such. Also agile customisation of all above.
DB,SECRET_KEY,DEBUG all should be stuffed in .env.
More settings u can find inside **settings.py** hope u know more what to do with this than me.


### **How to install**
0. To make this thing work u need to install **uv package manager.** u can read about it [on this link](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation)
    **TLDR**
    

    run this in ur linux console:

    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh


    Windows version:

    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

    U're magnificent

1. clone my repo in  any folder on ur system(pref linux :P) 

2. print in cmd next commands from repo root 
    1. make install
3. AAAAnd next instructions how to deploy this u find on [on this site](render.com/docs/deploy-flask)
    P.S all required commands for server run codded into build.sh

To start DEV server to configure things or try it use command make start

# IMPORTANT Dont forget to gitignore .env file otherwise it's on u /o_o\



Done now u can deploy ur very own web application, and u can still ask me why i even do this(God forgive me).

Now im free. Now i can do my own stuff. Mb i will come with this soon.
